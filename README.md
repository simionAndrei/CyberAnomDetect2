# CyberAnomDetect2

* `arma.py` - helper functions used for analysis
* `Arma-results.ipynb` - notebook used for the analysis
* `arma_detect_model.py` - model class and the main for running the ARMA prediction
* `arma_detect_model_residuals.py` - model class and the main for running the ARMA residuals
prediction, which presented very weak results
* `scores.py` - helper functions used to calculate the scores for the models
* `n_gram_model_combination.py` - Employs the same tactics as `n_gram_model.py` but additionally sorts the most relevant 5 signals from the optimization set and uses it to calculate the final prediction
